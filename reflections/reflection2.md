## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

1. Achieving a functional user matching algorithm
2. Successfully implemented the user accounts, user interest form, and video chatrooms

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

1. Had trouble achieving a functional user matching algorithm
2. Had trouble incorporating the Twilio API to our deployed website as there were CORS issues

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

1. We finished all the tasks planned for this sprint. However, we are missing basic CSS which is to be implemented for the next sprint

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

1. The resources provided to us were of much help to distribute and set up the work. We were able to deploy our website thanks to the deployment guide shared by one of our peers.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

1. At this time, there are no features or user stories at risk. However, if we were to find later on there were certain features that would take some time to implement, we will change our plans based on the amount of time it would take and how much value the feature would bring to our users.
