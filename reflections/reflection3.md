## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We have successfully:

- Implemented a text chat-room feature.
- Implemented a feature where users can seek who they previously matched with for networking purposes.
- Implemented a mute and turn off video button, along with an icon indicating whether a user is muted or if there video is turned off.
- Created a logo and settled on a color scheme for our project.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

This week we faced a few challenges with bug fixes. One major struggle was fixing a bug in which both users' microphones would be muted if either user pressed the mute button. We also came across another issue where users would be quickly flashed with the 403 error page whenever they were loading into a video chat room. We were able overcome both challenges.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We've finished all of our sprint tasks for this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources Codepath provided in our course portal for creating a low-fidelity wireframe, project-board and overall for sprint planning has been a great help while creating this project.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

At this time, there are no features or user stories at risk. However, if we were to find there is a certain feature that would take some time to implement, we will change our plans based on the amount of time it would take and how much value the feature would bring to our users.
