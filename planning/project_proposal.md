## Problem Statement

Roughly 70 percent of people fail to achieve the goals they have set for themselves, especially when it comes to completing work and study goals, due a multitude of reasons (lack of motivation, failing to plan, inactivity, etc.)

## Description

According to Reliable Plant, approximately 80 percent of people never set goals for themselves and of the 20 percent of the population that does set goals, roughly 70 percent fail to achieve the goals they have set for themselves. This statistic is due to a lot of different reasons; people often state they want to achieve a certain goal but aren't really committed to it, people that lack motivation for their goals, people that lack understanding of the goal-setting process and fail to plan properly, and the list goes on. One of the main advice that people are given when they want to achieve a goal is to find an Accountability Partner, due to the fact that having an Accountability Partner will increase your chances to success by 95%. However, oftentimes it's hard for people to find an Accountability Partner.

The main purpose of this project is make it easier fo someone to find people who share the same desires of keeping themselves on track with their goals free of charge. Users will be able to specify what they want to work at that time and then get matched with someone with similar goals into a virtual room where they would sit down together and work towards their tasks in that session. Users will able to make a profile where they will have a list of people they previously matched so they can have the chance to connect with them outside of the website to cultivate long-lasting professional relationships.

## Expected Features List

- User sign up/login
- User edit profile
- List of accounts that a user was matched with previously, along with their contact information
- Virtual rooms with webcam, voice, and chat capabilities, via Twilio API
- Report users for abuse, harrassment, and violating Code of Conduct

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

- Omegle
- Supporti
- Coach.me
- Focusmate

Omegle allows you to be paired randomly with another person to talk one-on-one and you can add your interests to be randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same interests. This project will do something similar but it's strictly in a professional, working setting and you'll be able to keep track with who you were previously matched with as well report inappropriate behavior.

Supporti matches people together one-on-one for daily support through a mobile app and every 7 days, you can change your accountability partner if you weren't compatible. This project will be a web app where you keep track with the people you were matched with along with their contact information so if you found someone you're compatible with, you have the ability to reach out to them after the session to continue the professional relationship.

Coach.me and Focusmate are free at first but requires payment if you want to continue the service or access certain features. Our project will be free for the user for the whole time.

## Open Questions

- How will we connect user id and user interests in order to connect them to the right room?
- How will we keep track of user interests?
- What are other video APIs we can use in case the Twilio API doesn't work out?
