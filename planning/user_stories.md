## Problem Statement

Roughly 70 percent of people fail to achieve the goals they have set for themselves, especially when it comes to completing work and study goals, due a multitude of reasons (lack of motivation, failing to plan, inactivity, etc.) Our target audience is people who struggle to find accountability buddies that can help them form healthy habits that can help them achieve their goals.

## User Roles

Buddy: a user who is seeking to remain productive, to find motivation, and for possible networking opportunities

## User Personas

Peter:

   Peter is a sophomore at college living in a suburb in Miami, Florida. He is looking forward to transferring to a University by the end of the year but fears his grade point average may lower before that happens. As a full-time student and employee at the same time, he struggles to stay motivated after extensive work shifts, and often sacrifices coursework for some rest or recreation. Additionally, as an online student, he lacks acquaintances to study with on campus, and therefore looks for a way to study with someone that fits into his schedule. 

Lisa:

   Lisa is a 25 year old professional software engineer, currently working at a startup in Chicago, Illinois. Lisa is fairly experienced in the field, so accordingly she has great knowledge of computer programming. The company Lisa works for greatly encourages working remotely, so she typically uses her desktop for doing work. Although she stays home most of the time, Lisa always loves meeting and working with people who are also passionate about programming. After searching for a solution that could help fulfill this hobby, she discovered [our app]. Now she can meet and study with others who share similar interests.
    
Maria:

  Maria is a 31 year old living in Boulder, Colorado. She is a full-time worker who has been learning python on her own through udemy courses at her own pace. Although she feels she has made considerable progress in her self-study, she wants to invest more of her time in her studies than before; for that, she would like to count on the motivation, support and feedback that a peer or classmate provides. Maria is seeking to interact with students with the same area of focus in order to network and earn a more complete learning experience. 

John:

  John is a 35 year old music artist from Los Angeles, California. As a musician, John loves to travel to different areas of the country to look for opportunities and to draw inspiration. So he always brings his laptop with him. However, because John is always on the move, he finds it difficult to find people who will help motivate him and work with him. When using [our app] , John can now be more productive in creating his music by working with others all while he is traveling.
